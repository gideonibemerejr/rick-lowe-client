Founded in 1993 by Lowe, Project Row Houses is an arts and cultural community located in Houston’s significant, historical Third Ward – one of the city’s oldest African American neighbourhoods. Much of Lowe’s interest and adept skill with collaboration comes from his family upbringing, where he was surrounded by a large family of four brothers and seven sisters. This sense of familial community is closely mirrored in many of his projects that focuses on building and nurturing relationships."

                                The Domino Effect: Rick Lowe's drawings<br />
                                <br />
                                Rick Lowe’s first solo exhibition comprised entirely of drawings is currently installed at the Hiram Butler Gallery, Houston. Walking into the show, a viewer may be struck by the diversity and visual richness
                                of the nine works on view, which as a group explore essential visual elements such as line; shape; color; composition; the physicality of materials and changes to their character that take place when they are
                                layered one on another; as well as spatial implications such layering evokes. In many respects, the drawings are not what we might anticipate in approaching an exhibition of Lowe’s artistic production, given
                                the project for which he is best known, and for which he was granted a MacArthur Foundation “genius” award in 2014. <br />
                                <br />
                                Born in 1961, Lowe has spent the past twenty-five years passionately committed to Houston’s Project Row Houses (PRH), among the most successful and admired long-term social practice (social sculptures, in
                                Lowe’s terms) art projects in the United States (perhaps any place). Rather than engaging in the intimacy associated with the act of drawing on paper, Lowe’s gaze necessarily has been directed outward,
                                surveying and altering his surroundings, and through his generous spirit has been generating interest in community-based projects far afield from Houston. <br />
                                <br />
                                Lowe’s concern for his surroundings has several different roots, including childhood experiences in Russell County, Alabama, between Eufaula to the south and Phoenix City to the north. His artistic origins
                                include the study of portraiture and landscape, the latter being the subject which most interested him as an art student at Columbus State College (now University) in Columbus, near Fort Benning, Georgia,
                                across the state line from Lowe’s rural Alabama home.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                This early representational work was followed by imagery rooted in political issues facing the broad African American community, paintings and drawings as well as assemblage constructions, often recycling
                                elements from one work in subsequent installations. Although he successfully exhibited at venerable institutions such as Houston’s Contemporary Art Museum, the young artist eventually decided that social
                                action would be more effective than a gallery-based practice, at which point he submerged his painting, drawing, and assemblage concerns to focus on PRH. <br />
                                <br />
                                Throughout the decades in which he engaged social sculpture, Lowe maintained a close friendship with painter Jesse Lott. Through conversations with this important mentor, as well as intellectual interactions
                                with Lott’s art, Lowe became increasingly aware of the humanistic importance that interiority-inflected, aesthetically-rooted work also contributes to a community’s ethos and an artist’s sense of self. Almost
                                accidentally, or at least without consciously definable reasons, Lowe began to make these new drawings on the backs of posters for a 1984 exhibition titled Collision at the University of Houston, given to him
                                by Lott (who was a participant in this important show). That urge to recycle materials, so important to the artist’s early installations and to the development of PRH, remains part of Lowe’s approach on paper
                                as well.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                All of the drawings are Untitled. As a group they employ a variety of color inks (black, white, red, green, blue, yellow) and diverse tools to apply them: ball-point pens and felt-tip markers of diverse
                                widths, some employing oil-based, others water-based ink or paint (WHICH IS IT, OR BOTH?), as well as ink sprayed onto the sheets with an atomizer. The drawings highlight forms and systems connected to the
                                highly visible practice of playing the game of Dominoes that is essential to Lowe’s community; and they are embedded as well with the undeniable metaphorical suggestion of “the domino effect” that for better
                                and/or worse plays a central role in contemporary culture, indeed in the game of life itself. The rectangular forms of dominos adjacent to and overlapping each other arrive at configurations that for the most
                                part fill the sheets, and have some association with maps and mazes that function within the broad context of drawing practice, particularly since the 1960s. <br />
                                <br />
                                Lowe has indicated that he generally starts in the center of a sheet and works outward in all directions; and that no one drawing is finished before another is started, that he “always works on multiple
                                pieces at a time,” drawing on one sheet until he reaches a point at which he would set it aside and start another. When “the impulse hit” he would return to one of the earlier beginnings, setting in motion
                                the cycle that eventually led to this related group. The central starting point is apparent in some of the drawings via a strong, irregular yet essentially circular shape that dominates their compositions,
                                and from which pathways out of the center emerge as the eye moves towards the sheets’ edges. <br />
                                <br />
                                Some drawings are quite open, the paper playing a vital, overall visual role, whereas others are densely worked, the substrate barely showing at all. Some reference Project Row Houses directly, others not in
                                any obvious way, except the Dominoes references. Those in the former category recognize through a text component such aspects of the PRH undertaking as Lowe’s inspiration in the work of artists Joseph Beuys
                                and Houston’s John Biggers; PRH’s earliest institutional support from the Houston-based Diverse Works (the list expanded on another drawing to include additional institutions – the Museum of Fine Arts and
                                Contemporary Art Museum, Houston among others); Lowe and other originators of PRH, including Lott are referred to as the “Magnificent 7” (this group grew substantially as well). As a text component on a
                                drawing, the “Magnificent 7” calls for the mention of John Sturges’ eponymous 1960 Western and Akira Kurosawa’s heroic 1954 Seven Samurai which inspired it, as an indication of Lowe’s film awareness. Also
                                referenced in texts on the drawings are important components of PRH: “YMPP” indicates the Young Mothers’ Residential Program; “ASP,” the After School Program; Duplex, the Rice University architecture
                                students’ designs for low-income housing; and a notation that in 1992 (as PRH was being envisioned), in a one and a half block area there were twenty-two shot-gun houses that functioned at its start. <br />
                                <br />
                                A strongly drawn domino configuration in a few works evokes a figurative motif, layered as it is atop the linear mass that covers much of the sheet. The drawings also are marked by multiple indications of the
                                Dominoes score structure, comprised of + and x symbols (often with initials of the players). These form a border on some sheets and are more diffusely distributed on others. Selected drawings feature dots
                                (both random and structured) that may be referring to the markings on the dominoes, although the more random dots seem less suggestive of the game than of the act of drawing itself.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Connected to the social sculpture that has consumed Lowe’s energy for a quarter of a century, these new drawings are also an introduction to his current search for meaning in artistic production that is meant
                                for gallery and museum contexts, stimulating thought that may lead to action, but that also may lead more readily to more thought, both for the artist and for his viewers. This may be seen as an old-fashioned
                                idea of the function of art, and it is. It is what allows us to feel connections with the Chauvet Cave paintings in Southern France, dating to 32,000-30,000 years BP; or the Magao Buddhist Grottoes in
                                Dunhuang, China, the earliest of which are dated to 266 AD. That today we make connections with ancient sites in cultures distant from our own is one way to grasp and understand positive relationships among
                                us, despite all diversity.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                At times of dissention such as our own, it is as important for art to function as a spiritual mechanism of connection and unity as it is for its social practice aspects to improve physical and psychological
                                conditions for those who so need it. Rick Lowe seems to have both sides of this coin covered, but the evidence of the former is just beginning to make itself clear in these beautiful and provocative drawings.
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                I am grateful to Hiram Butler for introducing me to Rick Lowe, and to the artist for generously sharing a chunk of his busy schedule while I recently was in Houston, as well as for his responses to numerous
                                follow-up email inquiries, from which brief quotations above are taken.
